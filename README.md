# Packuilon

A collection of scripts to allow OpenStack VM images to be automatically built based on personalities from Aquilon. It uses Packer (https://www.packer.io) to do the image building. 

# cdb2rabbit

Checks for changes to the continuous integration profiles (or profiles defined by a "PROFILE_MATCH" string, which can be left blank for all profiles), and pushes a message to a RabbitMQ queue. Can be called by cron, or by quattor (using ncm-cdispd). The message is just the profile object (json encoded).

#rabbit2packer

Listens to the RabbitMQ queue. When one is received it creates a packer build file and starts the packer process.

The build file is created from a template which contains the source image, network etc. It should contain the strings $NAME, $IMAGE and $METADATA which will be replaced by the name of the image, the source image and the instance metadata (currently just the AQ\_PERSONALITY, AQ\_OS and AQ\_OSVERSION).

The source image for each operating system type is defined in a separate config file defined in the main config.ini (`/etc/packer-utils/source-images.json` by default). The file contains key value pair structure, with the key being the OS, the sub-key being the OS_VERSION, and the value of that subkey being the image ID to use. For example:

```
{
    "sl": 
	{ 
		"7x-x86_64" : "bc4118de-23fc-4cdf-8c32-cb794778d494",
		"6x-x86_64" : "d2eea166-b643-40f5-bb7f-ca17d2f1c6fe"
	},
    "os": { "os_version" : "image uuid" }
}
```

If there is no matching key for the image the build will be skipped. Otherwise Packer will be started with the created build file.

The instance metadata will be interpreted by a script running on our openstack 'stack' which will change the build hostname's personality to the one found in the message (https://github.com/stfc/SCD-OpenStack-Utils/tree/master/OpenStack-Rabbit-Consumer).

The packer shell provisioned then runs a fetch+configure with the new profile via the `update_ccm_conf.sh` script, which is executed on the instance, and assuming that doesn't error, a glance image will be created called $personality-$os. If the packer shell process exits without error a separate shell script (rename-old-images.sh) is called which renames the previous image to 'archive $image-name $date' and transfers the memberships from the old image to the new image.

This process is logged in separate log for each build, found in the `LOG_DIR`. Bear in mind that these are overwritten when a new build of that image starts, so there are no historical build logs kept. This is a area for improvement if anyone is bored.

#Installation

*this is mostly SCD specific*

The `image_factory` personality installs packer, packuilon, the SCD specific config and adds the ncm-cdispd hocks for cdb2rabbit. The host will need to be bound to an instance of the image-factory service to receive packets about profile rebuilds:

```
aq bind_server --service image-factory --instance scd-cloud-image-factory --hostname $hostname
```

The things you will need to source manually are the openstack credential files defined in the rabbit2packer section of the config. The `PACKER_AUTH_FILE` only needs to be able to create machines and images in its own project (which keeps things nicely partitioned), but in order to update memberships you need a 'admin' type account, hence the need for `ADMIN_AUTH_FILE`.

Currently you also need to sort the certbundle out so packer can talk to openstack. Manually copying over `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` from a openstack machine does the trick.

Once that's done, restarting rabbit2packer with `systemctl restart rabbit2packer.service` should get you a working instance. Both cdb2rabbit and rabbit2packer log to syslog to it's usually fairly easy to se what's going wrong by keeping an eye on `messages`, and you can just run both scripts from the command line if things are horribly broken.

A normal run should look something like:

```
